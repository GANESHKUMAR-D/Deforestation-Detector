# Deforestation-Detector
The project utilizes OpenCV and NumPy to detect and count trees, people, and faces in a real-time video stream captured from a webcam. It follows the principles of image processing and object detection, handling color-based segmentation for trees and Haar cascade classifiers for human detection.
